# 🔮 Predictive Lead Conversion Using Metadata

In many businesses, especially in B2B industries, the **lead conversion rate remains as low as 1.5%**, despite high volumes of incoming leads. This results in wasted marketing effort, lower ROI, and missed revenue opportunities.

This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to analyze **lead metadata**—such as source, region, industry, device, and engagement patterns—to predict the **probability of conversion**. This enables organizations to **prioritize, personalize, and optimize** their lead engagement strategies.
